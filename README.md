# Social Network API

## Description

- I wanted to create a back end tool that would provide users with the framework for a social netwroking website.
- The application can take a user's inputs to create, edit, and delete users and thoughts.
- I learned more about about using Mongoose models and a MongoDB database.

## Installation

- Get SSH key from https://github.com/Luwylbab/Social-Network-API

- Clone the repository using [git@github.com:Luwylbab/Social-Network-API.git]

## Usage

When a user synchs the Mongoose models to the MongoDB database, a server will be created. The user can then open the API routes in Insomnia and is free to view, add, update, and delete data in the database.
